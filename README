RunSlide 0.1
------------

**WARING: This is the FIRST release - it is very likely that EVIL stuff happens**

**** DO NOT RUN THE INCLUDED SERVER IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS ****


This small program generates interactive slides of HTML5 presentations.
Currently it enables users to edit code snippets within a slide, to run it, and
to display its output in a visually pleasant way.

You no longer need to switch between presentation software and IDEs or terminals
during your programming talks.

RunSlide is inspired by Google's present tool, but unlike present it is not
limited to the Go language.

The program starts an http server and offers a WebSocket connection.
HTML5 presentations use this WebSocket to send code snippets to RunSlide, which
starts the defined interpreter and responds with the output generated by the
code snippet.
RunSlide makes use of Go templates - before calling the interpreter, it may embed
the code snippet in a text file. So you can add include commands or helper
functions in a code template instead of showing them in your slide (see fibgo.tpl
as example).

Refer to the fib.html sample presentation to create your own slides.
Modify static/styles.css to change colors/fonts etc.

Installation:
-------------

- Install Go (golang.org)
- Install Chrome (www.google.com/chrome)

- extract RunSlides package

Start a presentation:
---------------------

- cd into the runslides directory
- execute "go run runslide.go"

Now a http server listens on port 12345.

Open the URL "http://127.0.0.1:12345/fib.html" in Chrome (23+).
Firefox (17) / Opera (12) do not work.
You will see a Fibonacci presentation. Click on "Run" to execute the shown
snippets. Edit the snippets to alter the output.
HINT: calculating huge Fibonacci numbers takes time.

Use arrow keys/ENTER/SPACE to navigate through the slides. Press F11 for
fullscreen mode.


TODO list (not implemented yet):
--------------------------------

- support compiled languages (run Makefiles)
- store templates/makefiles in subdirectories

BUGS
----

Does not work with Firefox and Opera
